## Overview üèÜ

**WeCode** is a web platform designed to make learning to code more accessible and engaging. Built from scratch in just **24 hours**, it uses an AI tutor to create customized learning paths for each user based on their interests and prior experience.

This project was developed for the HackTJ 2024 hackathon, where our team of four won the **Best Web Hack** award for its technical implementation and innovative approach to education.
