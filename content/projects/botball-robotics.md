## Overview

As President of the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's Botball Robotics team, I led our group through a successful season culminating in a **10th place finish** at the Global Conference on Educational Robotics (GCER), an international competition.

The project involved designing, building, and programming autonomous robots to complete a series of complex tasks. The codebase was primarily written in **C++ and C**, focusing on sensor integration, motor control, and strategic decision-making algorithms.

## Leadership & Project Management

My role as President encompassed a wide range of responsibilities beyond the technical aspects:

- **Team Management:** Hosted and led all weekly meetings, increasing frequency near competitions to ensure our team was prepared.
- **Logistics & Operations:** Managed all material purchasing and inventory. I was solely responsible for securing funding, booking travel and accommodation (Airbnb), and providing transportation for the team's trip to the international competition in Concord, North Carolina.
- **Technical Leadership:** Actively led the planning, building, and coding phases of the robot's development, providing guidance and assistance to team members.
- **Outreach:** Assisted with the team's social media presence to document and promote our progress.
